# *Targeted-Online-Marketing*
Profiling the target audience of an online advertisement to determine the best charactristics of persons who click on Ads.

## Overview
Targeted advertising is a form of advertising, including online advertising, that is directed towards an audience with certain traits,
based on the product or person the advertiser is promoting. These traits can either be demographic with a focus on race, economic status,
sex, age, generation, level of education, income level, and employment, or there can be a psychographic focus which is based on the consumer values, 
personality, attitude, opinion, lifestyle and interest. This focus can also entail behavioral variables, such as browser history, purchase history,
and other recent online activities. Targeted advertising is focused on certain traits and consumers who are likely to have a strong preference. 
These individuals will receive messages instead of those who have no interest and whose preferences do not match a particular product’s attributes.
This eliminates waste.
